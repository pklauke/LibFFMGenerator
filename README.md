Unfinished script for converting csv data into the data format <a href="https://github.com/guestwalk/libffm">LibFFM</a> needs.

LibFFM Data Format
==================

The data format of LIBFFM is:

<label> <field1>:<feature1>:<value1> <field2>:<feature2>:<value2> ...
.
.
.

`field' and `feature' should be non-negative integers. See an example `bigdata.tr.txt.'

It is important to understand the difference between `field' and `feature'. For example, if we have a raw data like this:

Click  Advertiser  Publisher
=====  ==========  =========
    0        Nike        CNN
    1        ESPN        BBC

Here, we have 

    * 2 fields: Advertiser and Publisher

    * 4 features: Advertiser-Nike, Advertiser-ESPN, Publisher-CNN, Publisher-BBC

Usually you will need to build two dictionares, one for field and one for features, like this:
    
    DictField[Advertiser] -> 0
    DictField[Publisher]  -> 1
    
    DictFeature[Advertiser-Nike] -> 0
    DictFeature[Publisher-CNN]   -> 1
    DictFeature[Advertiser-ESPN] -> 2
    DictFeature[Publisher-BBC]   -> 3

Then, you can generate FFM format data:

    0 0:0:1 1:1:1
    1 0:2:1 1:3:1

Note that because these features are categorical, the values here are all ones.
